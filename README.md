# Chaotic_SFO
This code belongs to the Research Paper where ten chaotic maps are used to initialize Sailfish Optimizer Algorithm. 

All the code is implemented using matlab. Following is the description of the Files. 

main.m -- Main program to run. 
chaos.m -- ten chaotic maps are implemented and chaotic values are generated through this file. Credit is given to the author in this file. 
Get_Functions_details -- Implemented 1-23 benchmark functions, retrieved from the same author as chaos.m
initSFO -- initialize Sailfish population with randon values
initSFOchaos -- initialize Sailfish population with chaotic values - it has extra parameter to idenitfy the map number. 
BasicSFO -- This code is the most important one, implemented by the author herself. It is the implementation of Sailfish Optimization Algorithm (SFO) in matlab. 

How to run the code? 

Simply download all the code and run main file. You can change map number, function number, and number of iterations from this file. for the users' ease, this code also exports all the data into Excel sheet.
